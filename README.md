Current code is just plain html,js, css, Bootstrap. You can download and open the index.html file in any browser.

Todo: 
1. Fetch Goodreads API: my bookshelf that I want to share with anyone.
2. Re-build other web project: navbar, footer, responsive.
3. Create API for my website: images, read, write, fun.
4. JS only website: re-design and build in a creative and interactive way without using Bootstrap.
5. Interactive world map.
