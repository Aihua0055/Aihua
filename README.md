Current code is just plain html,js, css, Bootstrap. You can download and open the index.html file in any browser.

Todo: 
1. Fetch Goodreads API: my bookshelf that I want to share with anyone.
2. Re-build other web project: navbar, footer, responsive.
3. JS only website: re-design and build in a creative and interactive way without using Bootstrap.
4. Interactive world map.
